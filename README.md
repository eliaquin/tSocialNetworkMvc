Is an open source social networking web application that provides a robust app on which to build all kinds of social environments, from a campus wide social network for your university, school or college or an internal collaborative platform for your organization through to a brand-building communications tool for your company and its clients. But the main goal is communicate teachers and student than need to be connected but donâ€™t want to mix personal and professional environments.
